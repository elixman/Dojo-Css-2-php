              <p>“After one too many years of city living, we came to realise that our true dream lie in our roots. In early 2012 we moved from life in NYC to our farm in rural Tennessee. Our mission is to provide humanly and sustainably produced soap and skincare to our community, and to encourage other small businesses to embrace land stewardship and sustainable production. As we continue down the road we look forward to sharing our journey and reflection on what we’ve learned thus far. We hope to inspire others to pursue their dreams” Co-Founder Eileen & James Ray</p>
