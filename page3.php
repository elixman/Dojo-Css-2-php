                <p>It’s been hard to keep this one a secret, but excited to finally announce that as of September 2015, all Little Seed products will be produced using 100% renewable energy - we’re going solar! We’ve long been committed to having a positive impact on the environment, so after years of hoping and planning, we’re proud to finally achieve this goal. Our hearts are happy.</p>
